    <h5 class="card-title">Archery for everyone.</h5>
    <p class="card-text">--> Archery is an extremely accessible sport in countries around the world. It is a sport for all ages and abilities - and can be as recreational or competitive as the person taking part wants! <br>
        <br>--> Beware: Archery is addictive. One shot can have you hooked for a lifetime.<br>

        <br>--> While the elite athletes shooting at the Olympic Games might spend hours every day training, there is no need to dedicate so much time to archery if your goals are not so lofty. Casual archers make up the bulk of the archery fraternity and anyone can consistently hit the target with as little as an hour of practice. More advanced aspects of the sport, however, can take years to master. <br>

        <br>--> Do remember to be conscious of safety and your surroundings when practising archery. There are plenty of archery ranges and clubs with proficient coaches to guide you through your first steps into the sport.There are millions of archers all around the world. Do you have a reason not to join them? (original text from worldarchery.org)</p>

        Coach Yoshi have helped in my provincial team in Ecuador as a coaching assistant mainly for compound bow archers for 3 years. Since I move to Canada in the summer of 2017, I got my basic coach certification and I have helped for two years in my local club, Capital Region Archery Club. I'm looking to improve as a coach to help develop high-performance archers and para archers.

    <h1 class="card-title">Archery for everyone.</h1>
    <p class="card-text">--> Archery is an extremely accessible sport in countries around the world. It is a sport for all ages and abilities - and can be as recreational or competitive as the person taking part wants! <br>
        <br>--> Beware: Archery is addictive. One shot can have you hooked for a lifetime.<br>

        <br>--> While the elite athletes shooting at the Olympic Games might spend hours every day training, there is no need to dedicate so much time to archery if your goals are not so lofty. Casual archers make up the bulk of the archery fraternity and anyone can consistently hit the target with as little as an hour of practice. More advanced aspects of the sport, however, can take years to master. <br>

        <br>--> Do remember to be conscious of safety and your surroundings when practising archery. There are plenty of archery ranges and clubs with proficient coaches to guide you through your first steps into the sport.There are millions of archers all around the world. Do you have a reason not to join them? (original text from worldarchery.org)</p>

        ----> Josue "Yoshi" Arteaga picked up his first recurve bow in 2003, and he has been actively practicing for the past 13 years. A native of Quito, Ecuador, Yoshi began training with the provincial team from Pichincha in 2005. After two years shooting recurve only, he decided to transition to a compound bow. From 2006-2008, Yoshi competed in several national competitions and was ranked top archer in compound bow style in the country. After taking a break from the sport for a few years during his undergraduate studies, Yoshi returned to practice with the Pichincha team once again and became the assistant coach for the team's compound archers. In 2017, he traveled to Medell√≠n, Colombia, to participate in a workshop organized by World Archery Americas to be certified as a Level 2 Compound Coach. It was during that period of time that he realized how much he truly enjoyed coaching and helping his teammates improve their technique and performance in competition.

        ----> Yoshi moved to Canada in 2017 to study at the University of Alberta in Edmonton for his graduate degree in Ecology. He began investing in his coaching career soon thereafter. Now known as Coach Yoshi, he received his certification as a basic archery coach in 2018 from Coach Canada, and he has since been volunteer coaching locally at Capital Region Archery Club (CRAC). He has been trained as an intermediate coach, as well, and he has designed a one-year course for competitive development at CRAC for athletes of any age. Recently, Coach Yoshi was elected to train the Zone 6 team for the Alberta Winter Games in February 2020. He continues working to improve as a coach and develop high-performance archers. He also aspires to be certified as a coach for para archers.
